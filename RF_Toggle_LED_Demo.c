/******************************************************************************
* CC430 RF Code Example - TX and RX (fixed packet length =< FIFO size)
*
* Simple RF Link to Toggle Receiver's LED by pressing Transmitter's Button    
* Warning: This RF code example is setup to operate at either 868 or 915 MHz, 
* which might be out of allowable range of operation in certain countries.
* The frequency of operation is selectable as an active build configuration
* in the project menu. 
* 
* Please refer to the appropriate legal sources before performing tests with 
* this code example. 
* 
* This code example can be loaded to 2 CC430 devices. Each device will transmit 
* a small packet, less than the FIFO size, upon a button pressed. Each device will also toggle its LED 
* upon receiving the packet. 
* 
* The RF packet engine settings specify fixed-length-mode with CRC check 
* enabled. The RX packet also appends 2 status bytes regarding CRC check, RSSI 
* and LQI info. For specific register settings please refer to the comments for 
* each register in RfRegSettings.c, the CC430x513x User's Guide, and/or 
* SmartRF Studio.
* 
* G. Larmore
* Texas Instruments Inc.
* June 2012
* Built with IAR v5.40.1 and CCS v5.2
